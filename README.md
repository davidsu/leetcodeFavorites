# USAGE &middot; ![Node.js CI](https://github.com/davidsu/leetcodeFavorites/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

first you'll need to let leetcode-cli create cache your usename/password: `yarn leetcode user -l`

will be slow on your first few usages since it will be downloading "stuff". Once things are cached it will get faster.

make sure to add things to your leetcode favorites as you see interesting questions you want to revisit and erase favorites once you master a give question.

every time you run this tool, a new file will be created in `/tmp/leetcode/{filename}` and problem description print to the console.

read the leetcode-cli on how to test/submit.

## HAVE FUN.
